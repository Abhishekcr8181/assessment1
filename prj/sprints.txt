First Sprint

1. First focus on building a simple-as-possible webshop so we could at least present the product catalog and allow customers to purchase single products;
2. Then focus on building a dashboard where widgets from the various products can be integrated into a single overview of what is important;
3. Then focus on expanding the lockedMe.com with support for complex purchases with multiple licenses and users;
4. Then focus on making branded versions of the product available to large customers;
5. This strategy helped inform the goals for the first dozen Sprints


Second Sprint

1. Create a sticky-based Sprint Backlog and Product Backlog on the wall in the team-room;

3. Set up a build server to build commits, run unit tests and compile deployment packages;
4. Set up a distributed service bus ;
5. Before deploying to production, automatically back-up the database;
6. Set up an empty API that connects to any empty database;
7. Before deploying to production, automatically run integration tests on API;
